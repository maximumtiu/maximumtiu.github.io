I'm a full-stack web developer, engineering leader, and educator. I'm currently working as a Senior Engineer at [Calendly](https://calendly.com) and am serving as a Director of [Ruby Central](http://rubycentral.org).

I love helping other developers grow, leaving codebases cleaner and I found them, and optimizing performance. I'm also passionate about diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech and building a positive, accessible community for all. I genuinely love the work I do.

I graduated magna cum laude from Georgia State University with a BA in Film and Television and I also completed the Tech Talent South Code Immersion Program. When I'm not glued to my computer, I love tabletop and video gaming, futzing with my many mechanical keyboards, and playing with my two rescue dogs.
