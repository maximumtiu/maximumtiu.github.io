title: A RailsConf Local's Guide to Atlanta | Max Tiu
permalink: /atl
---

After 8 years away, RailsConf is back in Atlanta! Because I deeply love both the Ruby/Rails community and my home city of Atlanta, I want to get y'all out of the conference/touristy area with all the hotels and sports stadiums and instead show y'all a lot of what this city has to offer. I won't be covering all the typical toursit attractions an Atlanta guide might show you (the Georgia Aquarium, the World of Coke, etc), but rather spotlight some other areas where Atlanta really thrives.

## Transit

For starters, if you're in the conference hotel or one of them nearby Downtown, you're steps away from the Peachtree Center Marta station (which also happens to have the southeast's longest escalator). If you're flying in to ATL, I **highly** recommend you take the train; the airport has a Marta station inside and it's a straight shot on the same train to Peachtree Center. [Fare is only $2.50, plus an extra $2 the first time you buy a Breeze Card](https://itsmarta.com/fare-programs.aspx), but it's reloadable. It also works for the Streetcar, which runs in front of the hotel.

## Neighborhoods

After a full day of conferencing when you wanna spend a nice evening with your Ruby Friends, I highly recommend choosing a neighborhood and walking around to the different places in the area if you're able. Atlanta is largely a city of sprawl, but there's a bunch of dense pockets full of stuff to do that are scattered around town.

* **via a short walk**: If you're looking for a quick bite to eat near the hotel, Broad Street is your best bet Downtown. It's got a ton of small eateries that usually cater to the weekday GSU students and office workers. Some of my favorites here are Dua (Vietnamese) and Naanstop (think Indian Chipotle). Reuben's is the best if you want a sandwich and Rosa's has great NY-style pizza.
* **via train**: On paper, Decatur is technically a "suburb" of Atlanta, but most of us consider it one and the same. Downtown Decatur has tons and tons of good food, drink, shops, sweets, and more. Some of my favorites along Decatur Square:
  * Raging Burrito & Taco - not authentic, but damn good. Great patio to boot.
  * Brick Store Pub - if you like beer, definitely stop here.
  * Iberian Pig - Spanish tapas, etc.
  * Butter and Cream - the best ice cream in the city IMO
  * [Eddie's Attic](https://eddiesattic.com/)
* **via rideshare**: Summerhill
  * Big Softie - soft serve ice cream (vegan options available)
  *
* Beltline
* Inman Park
* EAV
  * Mary's üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
  * Gaja
  * Joe's for coffee
  * Argosy
* **via rideshare**: Little Five Points
  * Criminal Records
* **via train**: The Lee & White development in the West End neighborhood has a variety of food and drink

## Food Halls

* the OG: Sweet Auburn Market
* Krog
* PCM
* Chattahoochee Food Works

## Outdoors

Atlanta is the greenest city in the US: we have more forest cover than any other major city in the country. You'll see trees all around you, even in the dense areas in Downtown and Midtown, but we've also got some great outdoor spaces, whether you're looking for a hike or just some fresh air and vibes.

* For something weird, check out the Doll's Head Trail.
* Sweetwater Creek Park
* Palisades Trail at the Chattahooche National Recreation Area
* Cascade Nature Preserve - a waterfall in the city (A short drive from the Lee + White area if you want a drink/bite after your hike.)
* For something spooky, Oakland Cemetary is a nice stroll and has some famous graves. (Eat at Six Feet Under nearby and follow it up with Little Tart Bakeshop.)
* Bellwood Quarry - the city's biggest park (A short drive from Chattahoochee Food Works or the West Midtown neighborhood)

## History

You probably _will_ find this stuff on typical tourist guides, but given that Atlanta is full of rich history, particularly surrounding the civil rights movement, I'd be remiss not to mention it:

* [The King Center](https://discoveratlanta.com/things-to-do/history/the-king-center/), including MLK's birth home, the Kings' tomb, and Ebenezer Baptist Church
* National Museum for Civil and Human Rights

## Downtown

If you _really_ don't want to venture away from the conference area, here are your best bets Downtown:

* [Aamar Indian](https://goo.gl/maps/QFaowNh1crG5EW7s8) - a hole-in-the-wall Indian spot at the bottom of a parking deck. Very tasty, but not great for a big group
* [Alma Cocina](https://www.alma-atlanta.com/downtown-hours-and-location/) - nicer Mexican
* [The Sun Dial](https://www.sundialrestaurant.com/) - a restaurant at the top of the conference hotel featuring stellar views of the city
* [Amalfi Cucina](https://www.amalfiatl.com/) - pizza, Italian, etc.
* [Land of a Thousand Hills](https://landofathousandhills.com/pages/location-flatiron-building) - local coffee inside the Flatiron building (built before the NYC Flatiron!)

## Waffle House

Out late? For a real ATL experience, find a Waffle House. They're always open (to the point of [FEMA using them to determine disaster levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle_House_Index)) and if you've been drinking, nothing sops up alcohol like Waffle House. It's a rite of passage.
